# sonar-shape-classifier
Deep learning project done for PHY473O Electronics Modal - Sound and Speech. Developed in Python (Tensorflow) a convolutional neural network pipeline that permits the use of a HC-SR04 Arduino SONAR, despite its low lateral precision, to collect data on an object and determine whether it has a cylindrical or a flat contour.
